<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have started working on HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript some years ago (about 7 years back) and I wanted to start again programming in order to remember.</p>

<p>From then until now, I have been doing jobs that were not related to web programming, resulting in me not practicing it and not remembering it well.</p>
<p>Such jobs were:
  <ul>
    <li>L1 Customer Technical Support for Vodafone Greee</li>
    <li>Field Technician for Vodafone Greece (fixing issues with landlines and internet (POTS/VDSL)</li>
    <li>IT Support for big companies like Nokia, Microsoft, Llodyr's Register</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to make my own projects in order to find a job that is related to Web Development</p>
